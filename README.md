## Desciption

This webpage was made using bootstrap with a little CSS inside of the <head> in the HTML document. It includes an <About Me> page as well as a <Portfolio> and <Contact> page.

The <About Me> <img> took some time to get right and I needed to look up about "hspace", "vspace" and "ALIGN" to help move it to the left and have some space inbetween the picture and the words.

The <Contact> page was simpiler due to Bootstrap but I was unable to figure out how to get the form input box to span more of the body of the form itself.

The <Portfolio> was more difficult because of how much the pictures kept adjusting when I would adjust the size of the webpage. I also used "hspace", "vspace" and "ALIGN".

The <navbar> and <footer> were simple due to using Bootstrap, I just needed to add the correct links and names.
